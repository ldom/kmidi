# kmidi
*Monitor your Kafka cluster performance using music*

Kmidi is a set of 2 python scripts that let you hear how your Kafka cluster performance is doing. 

There is a producer script that sends MIDI notes to a topic and there is a consumer script that reads those notes and plays them to your sound card.

## Installation

On the instrument side, in addition to python3 and the py libraries used, you'll need a way to turn the MIDI notes into actual sound... For this I'm using fluidsynth, which uses SoundFont files.

I am including a small Stenway piano file (Steinway_B-JNv2.0.sf2).

It comes from https://sites.google.com/site/soundfonts4u/ and if you wish to use another one. Feel free to substitute it in the command-line examples below. Just remember that you need a SoundFound file that matches the instruments included in the MIDI files.

To install `kmidi`, download or fork this repo, create a virtualenv, then:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt 
brew install fluidsynth
```

and test your fluidsynth setup with:

```
fluidsynth  Steinway_B-JNv2.0.sf2 midi/bwv988.mid
``` 

You should hear the lovely Aria of the Goldberg Variations by JS Bach.


## Run kmidi

To run kmidi, open 3 terminal windows.

If topics are not created automatically (they shouldn't be), create one for the midi notes:
```
kafka-topics --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --create --topic midi_notes --partitions 12 --replication-factor 3
```

1- Run the synth in server mode:
```
fluidsynth ./Steinway_B-JNv2.0.sf2 --portname=fluidsynth -s
```
 
2- Run the consumer (default values are `--bootstrap-servers localhost:9092  --notes-topic midi_notes`):
```
python kmidi_instrument.py 
 
```
3- run the producer:
```
python kmidi_player.py -m midi/*.mid
```

You should now hear some lovely music. 

Load your Kafka cluster test using `kafka-producer-perf-test` and `kafka-consumer-perf-test`.

The producer sends the notes to the topic respecting the melody. It pauses the proper amount of time before sending the next note(s). The consumer plays the notes as they arrive. So when the music slows down, you know that your cluster throughput is decreasing... If the melody gets wrong, with silences too long  and irregular between notes, it shows a certain inbalance between consumers. 

Et voil√†.

Notes: 
- You should adjust the number of partitions and replication factor to match your typical cluster setup.
- The script uses the name of the MIDI file as the key so notes should be read in sequence. If you want to hear what happens to the ordering when a consumer is reading from multiple partitions, edit the `producer.produce()` call in `play_notes()` of `kmidi_player.py`, but it may not be pretty to the ear!
